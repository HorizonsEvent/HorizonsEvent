- 👋 Hi, I’m @HorizonsEvent
- 👀 I’m interested in learning code and writing applications 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my very first project 
- 📫 You can reach me via email at jos.all@1horizonsevent.com
- 😄 Pronouns: he him his
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have absolutely ZERO experience with code. This is going to be an ugly task and I'm going to ask questions that may sound stupid to others but are really that much of an unknown to me.
